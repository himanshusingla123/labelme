LabelMe is primarily a graphical image annotation tool, and its functionality is more evident through its graphical user interface rather than specific functions callable from a Python script. However, LabelMe does provide a Python API for programmatic access to some of its functionalities.

Here are some important aspects of LabelMe that can be accessed programmatically:

1. **LabelMe Python API Functions:**
   - **`labelme.utils.shapes_to_label()` and `labelme.utils.label_to_shapes()`:** Convert between image annotations in shapes format and LabelMe annotation format.
   - **`labelme.utils.img_b64_to_arr()`:** Convert base64-encoded image data to a NumPy array.
   - **`labelme.utils.img_arr_to_b64()`:** Convert a NumPy array to base64-encoded image data.

2. **Command Line Interface (CLI):**
   - **`labelme` command:** LabelMe provides a command-line interface to perform various operations such as converting annotations between different formats, creating a labeled image dataset, and more.

3. **LabelMe Graphical User Interface (GUI) Functions:**
   - **Drawing Shapes:** The GUI allows users to draw various shapes such as bounding boxes, polygons, and points on images.
   - **Labeling:** Users can assign labels to the drawn shapes.
   - **Image Navigation:** Navigate through images in the dataset for annotation.

4. **Export Formats:**
   - **Export to JSON:** LabelMe allows exporting annotations in a JSON format, which can be used for further processing in machine learning pipelines.
   - **Export to Other Formats:** LabelMe supports exporting annotations in various formats like Pascal VOC, COCO, and more.

5. **Web-Based Interface:**
   - **Web Server:** LabelMe can be run as a web server, enabling users to access and annotate images through a web browser.

Here's an example of using the LabelMe Python API for converting between different annotation formats:

```python
import labelme

# Load LabelMe annotation file
annotation = labelme.utils.shapes_to_label(
    image_path='path/to/image.jpg',
    shapes=[{'label': 'dog', 'points': [[0, 0], [10, 10], [10, 0]], 'shape_type': 'rectangle'}]
)

# Convert LabelMe annotation to COCO format
coco_annotation = labelme.utils.labelme_shapes_to_json(labelme_format=annotation)
```

Remember that LabelMe's primary use is for interactive annotation through its graphical interface. The Python API and CLI are provided to assist with tasks like batch processing and integration into larger workflows.
